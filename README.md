# McMakler code challange app

Dear McMakler reviewers, I hope you will enjoy my code! Have a good time!

I tried to create this application flexible and scalable (it is not necessary for such a simple app, but I keep in mind that you want to see what I can code for more complex apps), so it's easy to add more pages, business logic and components to extend it.
